- Each travels 50px from click point
- Creates star-burst effect
- Auto-cleanup after 500ms

### 6. Matrix Rain on Click

- Red and cyan ghost cursors
- Rapid position shifting
- Classic cyberpunk look

### 8. CRT Scan Line
- Horizontal scan line follows cursor
- Expands on click
- Retro monitor aesthetic

### 9. Hexagon Grid (25-75% Scroll)
- Rotating hexagonal targeting grid
- Appears mid-scroll
- Pulsing scale animation
- "Targeting system" vibe

| Button | [ ] | Brackets `< >` pulsing | Yes |
| Link | → | Trail, Glow | No (stays horizontal) |
| Text Input | \| | Blinking pipe | Yes |

### Click Effects (All Trigger Simultaneously)

1. ⭐ **Particle explosion** (8 particles, radial)
2. 🌧️ **Matrix rain** (6 falling characters)
3. 👻 **Glitch** (RGB split effect)
4. 📡 **Scan line expansion** (width doubles)

### Scroll Effects

**0-25% Scroll:**
- Normal cursor
- Beginning rotation
- Standard glow

**25-75% Scroll:**
- Hexagon grid appears
- Grid rotates at 2x speed
- Increased glow intensity

**75-100% Scroll:**

## ⚡ Performance

### Optimizations
- ✅ Uses `requestAnimationFrame`
- ✅ GPU-accelerated transforms
- ✅ Automatic cleanup (no memory leaks)
