## Methods to Recover Your Lost Posts

### Method 1: Supabase Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) ‚≠ê BEST OPTION

**Available on:** Pro plan and above ($25/month)

#### Steps:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database ‚Üí Backups**
3. Look for **Point in Time Recovery** section
4. Select a timestamp **BEFORE** the attack happened
5. Click "Restore" to recover your database

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Exact recovery to any point in time
- ‚úÖ Can recover to minutes before the attack
- ‚úÖ Most reliable method

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Only available on paid plans
- ‚ùå Must act quickly (retention varies by plan)

---

### Method 2: Daily Automatic Backups

**Available on:** All paid plans (Pro and above)

#### Steps:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database ‚Üí Backups**
3. Look for **Daily Backups** section
4. Find the most recent backup **BEFORE** the attack
5. Download or restore that backup

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Available on all paid plans
- ‚úÖ Free to restore

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Only daily snapshots (may lose up to 24 hours of data)
- ‚ùå Not available on free tier

---

### Method 3: Check if Data Was Soft-Deleted

Sometimes attackers just UPDATE fields rather than hard DELETE.

#### Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if posts table has any data at all
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_posts FROM posts;

-- Check what's in the posts table
SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100;

-- If you see weird data, check for patterns
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  content,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM posts 
WHERE updated_at > created_at  -- Posts that were modified
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

If you see posts with corrupted data (like all titles say "hacked"), you might be able to:
- Identify which posts were modified
- Contact users to re-post
- At least recover post IDs and timestamps

---

### Method 4: Browser Cache / Client-Side Recovery

If the attack happened recently, data might still be in users' browsers!

#### Create a Data Collection Page:

1. Add this to your app temporarily:

```typescript
// app/recover-data/page.tsx
'use client'

export default function RecoverData() {
  const handleExtractCache = () => {
    // Check localStorage
    console.log('LocalStorage:', localStorage)
    
    // Check sessionStorage
    console.log('SessionStorage:', sessionStorage)
    
    // Try to get cached network requests
    if ('caches' in window) {
      caches.keys().then(keys => {
        keys.forEach(key => {
          caches.open(key).then(cache => {
            cache.keys().then(requests => {
              console.log('Cached requests:', requests)
            })
          })
        })
      })
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="p-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl mb-4">Data Recovery Tool</h1>
      <button 
        onClick={handleExtractCache}
        className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded"
      >
        Check Browser Cache
      </button>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm">
        Open browser DevTools Console (F12) and click the button.
        Look for any cached post data.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. Share this page with recent users
3. Ask them to run it and send you any recovered data

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free
- ‚úÖ Might recover very recent posts

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Only works if users visited recently
- ‚ùå Manual and tedious
- ‚ùå Incomplete data

---

### Method 5: Check Supabase Logs

**Available on:** All plans

#### Steps:
1. Go to **Logs ‚Üí Database Logs** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Look for DELETE or UPDATE statements
3. Try to identify what was deleted

**Example queries to look for:**
```sql
DELETE FROM posts WHERE ...
UPDATE posts SET title = ...
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Can see what happened
- ‚úÖ Might show the data that was there

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Logs might not show full data
- ‚ùå Limited retention period
- ‚ùå Won't help you restore, just understand

---

### Method 6: Check if You Have Any External Backups

Did you ever:
- Export data for testing?
- Take screenshots with post IDs visible?
- Have analytics that captured post content?
- Use any monitoring tools (Sentry, etc.)?
- Have staging/development environment with copies?

---

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Check Your Supabase Plan

```bash
# Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR-PROJECT/settings/billing
```

**If you're on FREE tier:**
- ‚ùå No automatic backups
- ‚ùå No PITR
- You'll need Methods 3-6

**If you're on PRO or higher:**
- ‚úÖ Check **Database ‚Üí Backups** NOW
- ‚úÖ Look for PITR or daily backups
- ‚úÖ Restore ASAP before backup window expires

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic Queries

```sql
-- How many posts do you have?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts;

-- When was the last post created?
SELECT MAX(created_at) as last_post FROM posts;

-- When was the last modification?
SELECT MAX(updated_at) as last_update FROM posts;

-- Are there any posts left?
SELECT id, title, LEFT(content, 50) as preview, created_at 
FROM posts 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Document Everything

Before attempting recovery:

```sql
-- Create a snapshot of current state
CREATE TABLE posts_backup_pre_recovery AS 
SELECT * FROM posts;

-- Same for comments and reactions
CREATE TABLE comments_backup_pre_recovery AS 
SELECT * FROM comments;

CREATE TABLE reactions_backup_pre_recovery AS 
SELECT * FROM reactions;
```

## Recovery Process (If You Have Backups)

### For PITR:

1. **CRITICAL:** Note the exact time of the attack
2. Choose a restore point 5-10 minutes BEFORE the attack
3. Click "Restore"
4. Wait for Supabase to complete the restoration
5. Verify data is back:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts;
   SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

### For Daily Backups:

1. Download the backup file
2. Go to **Database ‚Üí Migrations** or use SQL Editor
3. You may need to:
   - Drop current tables
   - Restore from backup SQL
   - Or merge data if some legitimate posts were created after backup

---

## If Data is Unrecoverable

### Mitigation Steps:

1. **Communicate with Users:**
   ```markdown
   üö® Security Incident Notice
   
   We experienced a security incident where malicious users 
   exploited a vulnerability to delete posts. We've:
   
   ‚úÖ Fixed the security hole
   ‚úÖ Implemented strict RLS policies
   ‚úÖ Enhanced monitoring
   
   Unfortunately, some posts may have been lost. We apologize 
   for this incident and have taken measures to prevent future 
   occurrences.
   ```

2. **Add a "Report Lost Post" Feature:**
   - Let users report if their post is missing
   - Collect details: approximate date, title, content they remember
   - Manually recreate if possible

3. **Implement Better Protection Going Forward:**
   - Apply the secure schema IMMEDIATELY
   - Set up regular backups (upgrade plan if needed)
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement content moderation
   - Add honeypot detection

---

## Prevention for Future

### Enable Automatic Backups:

1. **Upgrade to Pro plan** ($25/month)
   - Daily automatic backups
   - 7-day PITR
   - Worth it for peace of mind!

2. **Set up custom backup script:**

```typescript
// scripts/backup-database.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import fs from 'fs'

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
)

async function backupDatabase() {
  const { data: posts } = await supabase.from('posts').select('*')
  const { data: comments } = await supabase.from('comments').select('*')
  const { data: reactions } = await supabase.from('reactions').select('*')
  
  const backup = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    posts,
    comments,
    reactions
  }
  
  fs.writeFileSync(
    `backups/backup-${Date.now()}.json`,
    JSON.stringify(backup, null, 2)
  )
  
  console.log('‚úÖ Backup completed!')
}

backupDatabase()
```

Run this daily with a cron job!
